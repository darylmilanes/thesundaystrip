                    The air in the private VIP lounge of the high-rise BGC hotel was thick with the scent of expensive scotch and unspoken agendas. Jace adjusted his silk tie, his heart pounding against his ribs, though his face remained a mask of practiced boredom.

                <p class="narrative-text">
                    Nakatayo si Vance by the floor-to-ceiling window, hawak ang isang crystal glass. Even from the back, the man exuded power—yung klase ng yaman na hindi na kailangang sumigaw.
                </p>

                    Vance chuckled darkly, placing his drink on the table. He didn't look at the documents. Instead, he stepped into Jace’s personal space. Masyadong malapit. Amoy ni Jace ang mamahaling pabango nito—a mix of sandalwood and something darker, musky.
                </p>

                <p class="narrative-text">
                    Vance had Jace pinned against the mahogany desk. Their breaths came in ragged gasps. Hands were roaming, desperate and possessive. Vance’s grip on Jace’s waist was firm, demanding total submission.

                    Jace tilted his head back as Vance’s hand slid under his shirt, exploring the warmth of his skin. Mainit ang palad ni Vance, madiin ang bawat haplos. It felt like branding.
                </p>
                <p class="narrative-text">
                    Vance bit lightly on Jace’s collarbone, eliciting a low moan from the heir. <span class="dialogue">"You’re beautiful when you’re desperate, Jace. Sobrang ganda."</span>

                <p class="narrative-text">
                    Inangat ni Vance si Jace paupo sa mesa, sweeping the expensive ornaments aside with a crash. Neither cared. Jace wrapped his legs around Vance’s waist, pulling him closer, seeking friction. The heat between them was suffocating, intoxicating.
